### Why Pay for Noise?

Cloud dictation services charge monthly fees for privacy-invasive APIs. VoiceFlow is essentially free, fully local, and yours forever.

### Unbreakable Privacy

Everything runs on localhost. Your microphone data never leaves your RAM. We physically can't sell your data because we never see it.

*   **Air-Gapped Safe**: Works completely offline.
*   **Open Source**: Verify the code yourself. Visualized via `View Source`.
*   **No Logs**: Processed in RAM, then discarded.

### Usage Flow

See exactly what VoiceFlow does at every step. No hidden processes, no cloud uploads. Just transparent, local AI.

</p>

#### 1. Ready
VoiceFlow waits silently in the background. A minimal indicator shows it's ready.

#### 2. Listening
Hold **`Ctrl+Win`** to speak naturally. Audio stays in RAM only. The interface visualizes your voice amplitude in real-time.

#### 3. Transcribe & Paste
Release the keys. Local AI processes audio, then auto-pastes text directly at your cursor.
